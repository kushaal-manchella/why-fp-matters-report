This repository serves as the CS 411 Final Project by Kushaal Manchella on the paper "why functional programming matters". PDF Link of the research paper can be found at https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf

Contents:

1. The Final project report pdf file: contains a 3 page summary of the paper
